# Widgets plugin

This plugin allows end users to create and edit various website widgets with a simple user interface.

## Counters

Display statistics or numeric information on your website with an animated attention-grabbing dynamic element that 
draws visitors in. Simply enter the number to display, fill in the text that explains what the number is about, 
and set an optional CSS class for the icon. Counters are managed via the component properties.

## Promotions

Promotions, such as content sliders and carousels, are simple to set up, totally customisable to the look and feel of 
your website, and allow you to showcase creative content in a relatively small footprint. Promotions are managed on the
Promotions tab of the Widgets plugin.
